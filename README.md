# Bioinformatics-Algorithms
*Bioinformatics Algorithms (Part 2) from University of California, San Diego*

####Course Syllabus
- Which Animal Gave Us SARS? (**Evolutionary Trees**)
- How Do We Locate Disease-Causing Mutations? (**Combinatorial Pattern Matching**)
- How Did Yeast Become Such a Good Wine Brewer? (**Clustering Algorithms**)
- Why Do We Still Not Have an HIV Vaccine? (**Hidden Markov Models**)
- Was T. rex Just a Big Chicken? (**Computational Proteomics**)
- What Genetic Characteristics Do Human Populations Share? (**Principal Components Analysis**)

This is the second course in a two-part series on bioinformatics algorithms, 
covering the following topics: evolutionary tree reconstruction, 
applications of combinatorial pattern matching for read mapping, gene regulatory analysis, 
protein classification, computational proteomics, and computational aspects of human genetics.
